# Quicktime/MP4 Fast Start for node.js

Enable streaming and pseudo-streaming of Quicktime and MP4 files by moving metadata and offset information to the front of the file.

The implementation is a plug-in replacement for `fs.createReadStream()` and works behind the scene to expose the input file as a fast start enabled stream.

## Usage

    var faststart = require('faststart);
    
    faststart.createReadStream('movie.mp4').pipe(â€¦);

## Methods

### faststart.createReadStream(path, [options])

Returns a standard readable file stream.

#### Extra options

* `passthrough` - Boolean. Set to detect non-movie files and don't try to "fix" them.

## Install

    npm install faststart

## TODO ##

* More documentation.
* Test case(s) for 64-bit.
* Resize-OK option (strip `free` atoms and convert to 64-bit when required).
* Pre-calculate output size.
* Support any _valid_ file by converting `stco` to `co64` when required.
* Command-line interface?
